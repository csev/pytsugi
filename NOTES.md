This repo uses some MIT licensed code from

https://github.com/tophatmonocle/ims_lti_py

I made my copy Wed Jun 21 09:01:59 EDT 2017

I had to do this because the PyPi code is broken

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ims_lti_py/0.5

And the more modern Harvard fork of this code, seems
also to be broken

https://github.com/harvard-dce/dce_lti_py

But the trunk of the trunk of the original code works.
I will figure out later why all that is true and maybe 
debug and send a PR to the Harvard code when I have
time.
